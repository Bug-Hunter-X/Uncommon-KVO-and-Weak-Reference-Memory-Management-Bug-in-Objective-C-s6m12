# Uncommon KVO and Weak Reference Memory Management Bug in Objective-C

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and weak references.  The issue arises when an object with a weak reference is observed, and that object is deallocated while the observation is still active.

## The Problem

The `bug.m` file contains code that illustrates the problem.  A weak reference to a string is observed. If the string is deallocated before the observation is removed, a crash can occur because KVO attempts to access deallocated memory.

## The Solution

The solution, found in `bugSolution.m`, addresses this by ensuring that the observation is removed before the observed object is deallocated, using appropriate memory management techniques. This prevents the application from attempting to access deallocated memory.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Run the application.
4. Observe the behavior; `bug.m` shows the crash-prone behavior, `bugSolution.m` illustrates the correct fix.

This example highlights the importance of carefully managing KVO observations, particularly when using weak references, to prevent unexpected crashes and maintain application stability.
